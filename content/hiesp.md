# Introduction - Helo ESP8266

Like the Arduino this microcontroller has programmable pins to interact with the real world, however while the Arduino operates and has a logic of 5V this microcontroller has 3.3V. This difference is very important to keep in mind while working with it, as not everything that works with Arduino will work "out of the box" on an ESP8266. The pins are organized as follows:
