# Requirements

To get started you will need latest version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
If you are using linux, make sure to add your user to the 'dialout' group or you won't be able to upload code.

After that is out of the way, just follow this quick guide to get the rest of the software installed.
